- Graph G can be characterized by counting homomorphisms from all graphs F to G.
=> G isomorphic to H <=> homomorphism from F to G equals F to H
- homomorphism vector is NP-complete
=> restrict to class where it can be computed in poly time

### Theorem 1
How expressive are homomorphism vectors $HOM_F(G)$ for restricted graph classes $F$? Consider the class $T$ of trees:
1. $Hom_T(G) = HOM_T(H)$
2. Color refinement does not distinguish $G$ and $H$
3. $G$ and $H$ are fractionally isomorphic, that is, the system $F_{ISO}(G, H)$ of linear equations has a non-negative real solution.



### ToDo
- References [18], [19]?
- homomorphism vector
- color refinement algorithm
